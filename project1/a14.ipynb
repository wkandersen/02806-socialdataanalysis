    "> * **Step 1**: Divide San Francisco into a grid of approximately $100\\text{m} \\times 100\\text{m}$ cells using latitude and longitude. It is fine to ignore that the Earth isn't flat — the approximation is good enough for this purpose.\n",
    ">     * **Hint**: `np.histogram2d` works well here. Focus on points within the SF peninsula; filter out geographic outliers.\n",
    "> * **Step 2**: Count the number of incidents of your chosen crime in each grid cell (use all years of data).\n",
    "> * **Step 3**: Tally the distribution. Count how many cells have exactly $k$ incidents — call this $N(k)$ — for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ up to the maximum.\n",
    "> * **Step 4**: Plot $(k+1)$ vs $N(k)$ on **linear axes**.\n",
    "> * **Step 5**: Plot $(k+1)$ vs $N(k)$ on **loglog axes**.\n",
    "> * **Step 6**: Does your crime follow a power-law spatial distribution? How can you tell from the loglog plot?\n",
    "> * **Step 7**: If crime is spatially concentrated in a small number of cells, what does that imply for how we interpret neighborhood-level crime statistics? Does the \"average block\" tell you anything useful?"
