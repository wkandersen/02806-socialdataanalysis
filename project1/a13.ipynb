    "## Assignment 1.3: Visualizing Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise asks you to recreate several classic plot types from DAOST Chapter 2 using your own crime data — putting visualization theory into practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Draws from*: Week 3, Exercises 5.2 and 5.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Part A — Jitter plot**\n",
    "> * Pick one of your Personal Focus Crimes and a suitable time interval (somewhere between a month and 6 months, depending on how common the crime is). Create a jitter plot of the incident times during a single hour (e.g. 13:00–14:00): let time run along the $x$-axis and add vertical jitter.\n",
    "> * What does the jitter plot reveal about how times are recorded in the dataset? Are incidents clustered at certain minutes (on the hour, half hour, etc.)? What does this tell you about the precision of the data?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Part B — Probability plot**\n",
    "> * Using the same geographic data from Part B, create a probability plot (QQ plot) for the latitude distribution of each of your two crime types. (`scipy.stats.probplot` is your friend here.)\n",
    "> * What reference distribution are you comparing against? What would it mean if the points fell exactly on the straight line? Where does the distribution deviate from normal, and what does that deviation tell you about the geography of crime in SF?\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Part C — Box plots of time-of-day**\n",
    "> * For each of your Personal Focus Crimes, extract the time-of-day of every incident.\n",
    "> * Create box plots showing the time-of-day distribution for all your Personal Focus Crimes side by side.\n",
    "> * What patterns do you see? Are there crimes that happen mostly at night? Mostly during business hours? For crimes that peak late at night, does the box plot handle the wrap-around at midnight well? What goes wrong?\n",
    "> * Above, feel free to use alternatives to box plots — violin plots, swarm plots, or raincloud plots — if you think they reveal more. If you do, briefly explain what the alternative shows that the box plot doesn't."
