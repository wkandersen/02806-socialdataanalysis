    "> * Visualize these ratios in a way that makes it easy to compare across both districts and crime types. (Simple barcharts are fine, but you may also use ideas from more complex visualization techniques, for example, a heatmap could work well here, but you're free to choose another format if you can justify it.)\n",
    "> * Pick **one district** whose profile stands out to you. Describe the pattern and offer an explanation for why that district looks the way it does. Are there geographic, demographic, or other factors that might explain it?"
