    "Above we see a visualization of the various types of crimes committed in the 11 districts of San Francisco. The data is visualized as a heatmap, in which each cell represents the conditional probability of a given crime in a given district. Thus, a value higher than one means that that crime is occurring more often than average, in the district. Above and to the right of the heatmap you see two bar charts. The top one shows the unconditional probability that if a crime occurs, it is in that given district. While the right bar chart shows the unconditional probability that if a crimes occurs, it is that crime (OBS. probabilities are only normalized with focus crimes, and not the total data set).\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the plot two thing become clear. Firstly, a very small amount of the crimes registered are \"ouf of sf\". This district is quite high in the \"non-criminal\" category. This suggests that SF Police is called out of the city, every now and then, to simply declare that something is perfectly legal. If it is a crime, it is most likely someone stealing something, either a car or something else. In and of itself, this is not that interesting, but considering that this is a data set for crime in San Francisco, it is curious that we have a district called \"Out of San Francisco\" and a category called \"non-criminal\".\n",
    "Moving on to SF we can see some interesting patterns. One that spring to mind is what is happening in the \"Southern\" district. This district does not spike out in any category, like we see with Tenderloin and drugs, instead it rests at a steady rate for each crime. In total, this district has the most crime, as seen in top bar chart. This suggests that criminals here are less picky at what crimes they commit, and instead try for a quantity over quality tactic. The most out-of-distribution crime in this district falls on the category \"warrants\", which in itself isn't a crime but typically suggests that a police investigation needs special permissions. Putting that together it seems that the Southern district of SF is one of the more \"harsh\" neighborhoods, and also one of the most policed. Which one causes the other, one can wonder?"
