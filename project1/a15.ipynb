    "Which of your Personal Focus Crimes share the most similar weekly rhythm — and which are completely out of sync?\n",

    "*Draws from*: Week 4, Exercises 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.\n",

    "Select **at least 4** of your Personal Focus Crimes for this exercise. More is fine - if you want to be closer to the actual weekly exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * For each selected crime type, compute the total number of incidents for each of the **168 hours of the week** (i.e., Monday 00:00–01:00, Monday 01:00–02:00, ..., Sunday 23:00–00:00). Each crime type will give you a vector of 168 values.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Scatterplot matrix**: Create a grid of pairwise scatterplots — one panel per pair of crime types, with one crime on each axis and each of the 168 hours as a point. Label each panel clearly with the two crime types being compared.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Linear regression**: Using the closed-form equations from Week 4 (not a library), fit a regression line $y = ax + b$ to each pair and add it to the relevant panel:\n",
    ">   $$a = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i y_i - N\\langle x\\rangle\\langle y\\rangle}{\\sum_i x_i^2 - N\\langle x\\rangle^2}, \\qquad b = \\langle y \\rangle - a\\langle x \\rangle$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **$R^2$**: Compute $R^2$ for each pair and display the value on each panel. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Looking at your results: which pair of crimes is **most correlated**? Which is **least correlated**? Does the answer match your intuition? Why might two crime types share a weekly rhythm — or not?"
