    "<mark>Please read the **[assignment overview page](https://github.com/suneman/socialdata2026/wiki/Assignments)** carefully before proceeding.</mark> This page contains information about formatting (including formats etc.), group sizes, and many other aspects of handing in the assignment. \n",

    "## Important Notes:\n",
    "**All exercises use your combined SF crime dataset** (2003–present) that you built during Week 2, along with your Personal Focus Crimes. Make sure you have those ready before you start.\n",
    "* **Hint**: The number of focus crimes are up to you, but choosing very few focus-crimes (1-5, let's say) feels like taking the easy way out to me, so to get top marks, you'll need 8 or more focus crimes (but it's not that more are better, 16 isn't necessarily better than 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each assignment draws directly on the weekly exercises - you should be able to pull your work directly from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "The same LLM guidance applies here as during the weekly exercises: use your LLM freely for coding, pandas syntax, and plot formatting. Do not use it for interpretation, reflection, or anything that asks for your own thinking. \n",
    "<br>  <br>\n",
    "If you use and LLM to cheat, you are missing out on your education ... it will mean that you're not getting all you can out of this class ... and, more importantly, that you are literally wasting this crucial time of your DTU-journey, designed to make you smarter and ready for the world.\n",

(Simple barcharts are fine, but you may also use ideas from more complex visualization techniques, for example, a heatmap could work well here, but you're free to choose another format if you can justify it.)\n",
    "> * Pick **one district** whose profile stands out to you. Describe the pattern and offer an explanation for why that district looks the way it does. Are there geographic, demographic, or other factors that might explain it?"

Create a jitter plot of the incident times during a single hour (e.g. 13:00–14:00): let time run along the $x$-axis and add vertical jitter.\n",

    "> **Part B — Probability plot**\n",

    "> * Above, feel free to use alternatives to box plots — violin plots, swarm plots, or raincloud plots — if you think they reveal more. If you do, briefly explain what the alternative shows that the box plot doesn't."
